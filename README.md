Have you wanted to run tests on a project that uses TypeORM directly on the database and in parallel? A lot of the time we can't do this because artefacts and data from other tests can affect the result of our current tests. What usually happens, in this case, is that our tests become quite complicated when database entities are involved because we need to track exact entities. Our `count()` and other aggregations must have `where` clauses so that we don't see results from other tests that have already completed.

This library introduces a way to wrap tests in a transaction and automatically roll back the commits when the test ends. By doing this, you are able to run multiple tests concurrently and their data will not be seen by others.

You may argue that we should mock out the entities and not use a database at all. This is a valid point, but sometimes we want to test database constraints and the effects they can have on application logic.

## Credit

Before I start, I did not add much to get this to work. The major reason why this is possible is because of the work done by [odavid](https://github.com/odavid) in his [typeorm-transactional-cls-hooked](https://github.com/odavid/typeorm-transactional-cls-hooked) library. Thanks for the great work [odavid](https://github.com/odavid)!

## Limitations

It has come to my attention that this library is **not** consistent if you use the `TypeORM` entity manager. So you'll want to use `typeorm-transactional-cls-hooked` to add the `@Transactional` decorator above function calls and those transactions will work correctly. What a colleague has found is that, when you use a `TypeORM` entity manager, they are independent of each other and data may still write to the database.

## Testing

Currently, I have created a small test suite that tests that there is a rollback in the transaction wrapper. The goal is to test as many database versions as possible, currently I have:

-   MySQL 5.7
-   MySQL 8.0
-   MariaDB 10
-   Postgres 9
-   Postgres 10
-   Postgres 11
-   Postgres 12
-   Postgres 13

The test badge represents tests that run over these databases: ![Build Status](https://github.com/entrostat/typeorm-test-transactions/actions/workflows/unit-tests.yaml/badge.svg)

## Getting Started

In order to use this project you need to install the package,

```bash
npm install --save typeorm-test-transactions

# Not removing from the typeorm-transactional-cls-hooked
# dependency separation. If you don't have the below
# libraries then you'll need to install them as well
# See https://github.com/odavid/typeorm-transactional-cls-hooked

npm install --save typeorm reflect-metadata
```

When running your tests (I'm using `jest` and `nestjs` as the example), you'll want to wrap your test functions in the `runInTransaction` function.

```typescript
import {
    runInTransaction,
    initialiseTestTransactions,
} from 'typeorm-test-transactions';
import { DatabaseModule } from '@modules/database/database.module';
import { Test } from '@nestjs/testing';

initialiseTestTransactions();

describe('Feature1Test', () => {
    beforeEach(async () => {
        const module = await Test.createTestingModule({
            imports: [DatabaseModule],
        }).compile();
    });

    describe('creation of 2 users', () => {
        it(
            'should allow me to create multiple users if the email address is different but name is the same',
            runInTransaction(async () => {
                await User.create({
                    email: 'email1@test.com',
                    name: 'Name',
                }).save();

                await User.create({
                    email: 'email2@test.com',
                    name: 'Name',
                }).save();

                expect(await User.count()).toEqual(2);
            }),
        );
    });

    describe('creation of one of the users in previous step', () => {
        it(
            'should allow me to create a user that is the same as the one in the previous step',
            runInTransaction(async () => {
                await User.create({
                    email: 'email1@test.com',
                    name: 'Name',
                }).save();

                expect(await User.count()).toEqual(1);
            }),
        );
    });
});
```

**IMPORTANT!** The example above wraps the entire test in a transaction and returns a function that `jest` executes. If you'd like to wrap *parts* of a test in a transaction, you need to **call** the function and `await` the result:
```typescript
import {
    runInTransaction,
    initialiseTestTransactions,
} from 'typeorm-test-transactions';
import { DatabaseModule } from '@modules/database/database.module';
import { Test } from '@nestjs/testing';

initialiseTestTransactions();

describe('Feature1Test', () => {
    beforeEach(async () => {
        const module = await Test.createTestingModule({
            imports: [DatabaseModule],
        }).compile();
    });

    describe('creation of the same user in different sequential transactions', () => {
        it(
            'allows me to create the same user twice if they were each in a transaction',
            async () => {
                await runInTransaction(async () => {
                    await User.create({
                        email: 'email1@test.com',
                        name: 'Name',
                    }).save();

                    expect(await User.count()).toEqual(1);
                })();
                await runInTransaction(async () => {
                    await User.create({
                        email: 'email1@test.com',
                        name: 'Name',
                    }).save();

                    expect(await User.count()).toEqual(1);
                })();
            }
        );
    });
});
```

## Troubleshooting

-   There are some cases when the transactions don't roll back. So far, I've found the reason for that to be that the `typeorm` connection was started before this package was initialised.
-   I have seen an issue opened [typeorm-transactional-cls-hooked initialization #30](https://github.com/odavid/typeorm-transactional-cls-hooked/issues/30) where there may be a problem around where you perform the initialisation. Once I get feedback, I'll update the documentation here.
